### Configuration:

Stored in `GAME_DIRECTORY/config/musketmod.txt`

Configurable values are durability, damage, bullet speed, maximum travel distance and accuracy.

Bullet spread follows normal distribution like in real life but it is awkward to configure. Here is a simple table that should help with that: [bulletStdDev](STDDEV.md "bulletStdDev")

Reload duration is not configurable with current implementation. It may change in the future.

### Permissions:

You may include this mod in any modpack, private or public, along with any modifications.

My sprites are free to use.
